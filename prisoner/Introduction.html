You will remain paired with the same participant for all {{C.ROUNDS_PER_SUPERGAME}} rounds of the game, and will then switch to play the next game with a different participant.

<h2>
    Actions and Points
</h2>
<p>
    In each round, both you and the other player (the person you will be paired with) will have to make a choice between two options. <span class="p1">You</span> will choose between playing <b>UP</b> or <b>DOWN</b> while the <span class="p2">other player</span> will choose between playing LEFT or RIGHT. You will make your choices simultaneously and privately. Your choices will jointly determine both your payoffs in points. These payoffs are detailed in the following table, with your payoffs marked in <span class="p1">blue</span> and the other player’s payoffs marked in <span class="p2">orange</span>:

<h4>Example for game score</h4>
<p>
    For example, assuming you chose <span class="p1">DOWN</span>, and the other player chose <span class="p2">LEFT</span>, this is how you will see the results on the table:
</p>
<!-- results payoffs table -->
<div class="form-group required hidden_info card mb-2 card-body bg-light">
    <table class="table table-bordered text-center" style="width: auto; margin: auto">

        </tr>
    </table>
</div>

<br> Note that <span class="p1 result_payoff">your payoff</span> is displayed in a large font and blue color. Your <span class="forgone">forgone payoff</span> is shown with a line-through decoration.
<p>Additionally, you will receive this information in a short text paragraph, like the one below:</p>

<div id='textual_results' class="hidden_info card mb-2 card-body bg-light">
    <p>
        You chose <b><span class="p1">DOWN</span></b> and the other player chose <span class="p2">LEFT</span>, hence 
        you <b><span class="p1">got {{example_payoff_p1}}</span></b>.<br>
        Had you chosen to play differently (i.e, UP) you would have <span class="forgone_text">gotten {{example_forgone_payoff_p1}}</span>.<br>
        The other player got {{example_payoff_p2}}.
    </p>
</div>

<h2>
    Decision Time and Feedback
</h2>
<p>
    To make a choice, you will need to press a button inside the table, either the ‘choose UP’ or ‘choose DOWN’ button.<br>
    In each round there is a time limit, you will have {{C.DECISION_TIMEOUT}} seconds to make your choice.<br>
    If you don't make a choice in time, the computer will choose one for you at random, and {{C.PENALTY}} will be deducted from your payoff for that round.
</p>
<p>
    Note that you will only be able to proceed to the next round after the other player has made their choice and also proceeds to the next round.<br>
After both you and the other player make your choices, you will see your payoff for that round. Additionally, you will see the payoff that you would have gotten had you chosen otherwise. Lastly, you will see the choice the other player made and the payoff they received.
</p>
{{ if is_description }}
<p>
    In each round, the history of choices and payoffs of both you and the other player will be presented to you, so you can review them before making a new choice.
</p>
{{ endif }}
<h2>
    Pairs and Rounds
</h2>
{{ if is_random_matching }}
    <p>
        Each round you will play with a <b>different player</b> who will be chosen at random. The game will be played for {{C.NUM_ROUNDS}}.
    </p>
{{ else }}
    <p>
        After {{C.ROUNDS_PER_SUPERGAME}} rounds are over, you will get a new partner to play the same game with. Overall, you will be matched with {{num_opponents}} different partners, playing {{C.ROUNDS_PER_SUPERGAME}} rounds with each (a total of {{C.NUM_ROUNDS}} rounds of the game).
    </p>
{{ endif }}
<!-- payment info -->
<h2>
    Payment Info
</h2>
<p>
    Your final payment for participating in the experiment will consist of a fixed payoff for your time (a "show-up fee") and a bonus you might receive based on your cumulative score in the game.
</p>
<div>
    The show-up fee is {{show_up_fee}} GBP.<br>
    The bonus payment will be an <b>additional {{bonus_fee}} GBP</b>. Your chances to earn this bonus depends on the number of points you accumulate throughout the games. <b>The more points you accumulate, the higher your chances of getting the bonus</b>.<br>
    Specifically, we will add {{C.RANDOM_BONUS_LOWER_BOUND}} points to the total number of points you accumulate and then divide the sum by {{C.RANDOM_BONUS_UPPER_BOUND}}. The result will represent your chance (in percentages) to win the bonus.<br>
    For example, if you accumulate {{bonus_example_points}} points, you will have a ({{C.RANDOM_BONUS_LOWER_BOUND}}+{{bonus_example_points}})/{{C.RANDOM_BONUS_UPPER_BOUND}} =  {{bonus_example_chance}}% chance to win the bonus.<br>
    This process means that to increase your chances of getting the bonus, you should <b>try to accumulate as many points as possible.</b>
